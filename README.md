# WC·26 — World Cup 2026 Companion

A fast, no-build fan site for the **World Cup 2026** — every match in your timezone, a **win probability + predicted scoreline** for every game, a favorite team that re-themes the whole UI, and a tournament that fills itself in as games are played.

**What's inside**
- **Matches** — every fixture in your timezone with a live hero + countdown, a **Match of the day** marquee pick, and a **Day in review** digest (recap: results · goals · top scorer · biggest result; preview: a "one to watch" pick + the rest of the day's games), navigable by date.
- **Live match detail** — score + minute that **refresh live in place** (open a running game and it stays current — score, minute, timeline, stats — without reopening), a **win probability + predicted scoreline** for the match (a Dixon-Coles model over an xG-aware Elo that updates after every result, refined by an attack-vs-defence read, host edge and late-group qualification stakes — with the reasoning shown), a goal/card/sub **timeline** (tap any player for a profile — photo, **age · height · weight**, club, caps, their **match log** + a per-match box score & what they did), **lineups on a formation pitch** (official player photos), a rich **match-stats** panel (possession, passing, tackles, saves, crosses… ~16 metrics) with **standout performers**, FIFA's post-match **deep analysis** (official xG, distance covered, heatmaps), and match facts (attendance, referee).
- **Teams** — tap any team anywhere for a detail sheet: overview, recent form, every fixture, the group standing + qualification outlook, a one-tap follow (re-themes the UI to their kit — contrast-guarded so it always stays readable), **squad rotation & minutes**, the full squad (with full-photo cards for your team), **"road to the final"** (a projected knockout route from live standings), a side-by-side **compare** against any other team, and a one-tap **calendar subscribe**.
- **Tables** — 12 live group tables + a "what each team needs to qualify" outlook, a **third-place race** tracker (the best-8-of-12 cut line the new format needs), and a collapsible **"projected Round of 32 if the groups ended today."**
- **Predict** — build up to **three what-if scenarios**: order every group, pick the best third-placed teams, then tap winners through the full knockout bracket to crown your champion (seeded from live standings so it's ready to play with right away), each with its own **path to glory**; see **how your call is tracking vs reality**, and **share a scenario as a ~30-character link**.
- **Stats** (Overview · Players · Teams · All-time · Ranking) — a tournament **overview** (goals/match, records so far: biggest win, fastest/latest goal, and a **confederation table** with each region's record + goals), the **Golden Boot** & **assists** races, **goalkeepers/clean sheets**, a stack of **team leaderboards** (pass accuracy, defensive actions, crosses, saves…), per-team **playing-style fingerprints** (with a per-metric explainer), a **suspension watch** and **fair-play** table, **all-time World Cup leaderboards** (career goals, appearances, World Cups played, titles… with this tournament's players tracked live as they close on the marks), a **player head-to-head** compare, and the **complete FIFA world ranking** (all 211 teams, filter to the 48 **WC qualifiers** and/or by confederation).
- **Players** — browse all **1,248 squad players** in one place: a fast search (name, club or country), a **position** filter, and a **searchable club picker ranked by how many players each club sends** to the tournament, with a bi-directional sort by 2026 goals, caps, age or name. Tap anyone for the full profile.
- **News** — the latest World Cup **headlines** from football desks worldwide (Guardian, BBC, ESPN, France 24, Al Jazeera, DW), newest first, with a live filter; each links out to its source.
- Plus: **global search** (⌘K — teams, players, matches), **installable to your home screen** (PWA), **dark mode**, an optional **stadium-mix** soundtrack, **match alerts** (goal/kickoff notifications) and **data-saver** mode, a **Settings** sheet, **calendar** export + **webcal subscribe**, per-match **share cards** that unfurl on social, an accessibility pass (keyboard focus, reduced-motion, screen-reader live goals), and a fully mobile-first, re-themable UI.

**Stack:** plain `index.html` + `styles.css` + one vanilla-JS `app.js` on GitHub Pages, fed by GitHub Actions that commit JSON into the repo. **No API keys are required to run it** — live scores, events, lineups, stats, player photos and player bios (age/height/weight) all come from free, keyless sources. Total cost: **$0**.

## One-time setup (~5 minutes)

### 1. Create the repo and push
```bash
cd wc26-site
git init && git add -A && git commit -m "kickoff"
gh repo create wc26 --public --source=. --push
# (or make an empty repo on github.com, then: git remote add origin … && git push -u origin main)
```
The repo must be **public** for free unlimited Pages + Actions.

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
**Settings → Pages** → Source: **Deploy from a branch** → Branch `main`, folder `/ (root)` → Save.
Live at `https://<username>.github.io/wc26/` within a minute or two.
> Update the absolute URLs in `index.html` (the `og:`/`twitter:` meta) to your own Pages URL so social previews point at your site.

### 3. Allow the Actions to push
**Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions** → **Read and write permissions** → Save.

### 4. Kick the data once
**Actions** tab:
- **Update scores → Run workflow** — first scores commit; then it keeps itself running (a self-relaunching polling loop), refreshing ~every minute during live matches.
- **Share cards** runs automatically after each scores update (renders the OG card per finished match).
- **Update squads → Run workflow** — *optional*; refreshes caps/goals/club via API-Football. All 48 squads already ship pre-filled from official FIFA squad lists.

### Optional API keys (you can skip all of these)
Add under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** only if you want them:
- `FOOTBALL_DATA_TOKEN` — a free [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org/client/register) token, used **only as a last-resort fallback** if both FIFA and ESPN are unreachable.
- `API_FOOTBALL_KEY` — a free [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com) key that lets the *Update squads* workflow refresh caps/goals/club. Without it (the default), all 48 squads still show — they ship pre-filled from official FIFA squad lists.

### Optional: analytics (off by default)
The site ships with **no tracking**. To turn on **cookieless, no-PII** analytics, create a free [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com) site and set `window.ANALYTICS_URL` in `index.html`'s head to your `…/count` endpoint — the script then loads and counts pageviews + per-tab views (via `goatcounter.count` in `nav()`). Leave it empty and nothing third-party loads.

## How it works

```
visitor's browser ── reads ──► index.html + data/*.json     (GitHub Pages, static)
                                          ▲
GitHub Action (polling loop) ── writes ───┘
        │  PRIMARY  api.fifa.com         → score, minute, events, lineups, photos
        │  STATS    site.api.espn.com    → possession, shots, corners, fouls
        └  FALLBACK worldcup26.ir → football-data.org (token, optional)
```

All sources are fetched **server-side in the Action** (even the CORS-enabled ones), so a vanished endpoint never breaks a visitor's page, and no keys ever reach the browser. The site polls `results.json` every 60 s while open, so scores update without a refresh.

## Data files (`data/`)

| File | What | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `matches.json` | 104 fixtures — UTC kickoffs, venues, stage/group, knockout slot placeholders (source: openfootball, public domain) | static |
| `teams.json` | 48 teams — names, kit colours, confederation, World Cup titles, and a seeded **Elo** strength rating (feeds the win-probability model) | static |
| `results.json` | per-match `{st,h,a,hp,ap,ht,at,min,ko}` — score/status only (the small file polled every ~60s); `ko` is the feed's real kickoff when it drifts from the static schedule | scores Action |
| `details.json` | per-match `{xi,ev,stats}` — lineups, event timeline, match stats (split out so it isn't re-polled every minute; the client merges it over `results.json`) | scores Action |
| `photos.json` | official player headshots harvested from FIFA lineups (`"ShortName|CODE"` → image URL) | scores Action |
| `squads.json` | 26-man squads per team | squads Action |
| `ics/*.ics` | static per-team + all-matches calendars for webcal subscription (schedule is fixed) | `scripts/make-ics.mjs`, one-off |

The favorite team, timezone and saved prediction live in each visitor's `localStorage` — they never leave the device.

## Updating the site

Edit anything, commit, push — every visitor sees it on their next load. **There is no build step for the site itself**; what's in the repo is the site.

**Manual score fix** (rare): edit `data/results.json` directly. Minimal per-match shape:
```json
"m12": { "st": "FT", "h": 2, "a": 1 }
```
`st`: `SCHED` | `LIVE` | `HT` | `FT` · `h/a`: goals · `hp/ap`: penalties · `ht/at`: resolved team codes (knockouts) · `min`: live minute. The heavy per-match detail (`xi`: lineups · `ev`: goal/card/sub timeline · `stats`: `[home,away]` pairs) lives in `data/details.json` (same `matches` keys), split out so the polled `results.json` stays small. Tap any match card for the full detail view.

**Share cards** are the one piece with npm build tooling (`scripts/make-share-cards.mjs` uses `satori` + `@resvg/resvg-js`; see `package.json`). They run only in their own Action — `node_modules` is gitignored and the core scores pipeline stays dependency-free. A few other assets are generated **once and committed** (no Action, no runtime cost): the social card (`scripts/make-og.py`, Pillow), the PWA icons (`scripts/make-icons.py`, Pillow), and the webcal calendars (`scripts/make-ics.mjs`, no deps).

## After the final (July 19)

The loop **auto-stops after 2026-07-20** (both "Update scores" and its "Restart scores loop (safety net)" have a date guard), so it won't run forever on its own. To stop it immediately, **disable both workflows** in the Actions tab (Actions → *Update scores* → ··· → Disable workflow, and the same for *Restart scores loop (safety net)*) — disabling only one isn't enough, since the restarter re-dispatches the loop. Do the same for **Share cards** if you like. The site keeps working forever as a frozen record of the tournament.

## Notes & honest limits

- **No keys needed.** FIFA's and ESPN's feeds are unofficial/undocumented ("use at your own risk") — that's exactly why everything is fetched through the Action with layered fallbacks, so the site degrades to scores-only rather than breaking if one source changes.
- **Group tiebreakers** implement points → goal difference → goals scored. FIFA's deeper criteria (head-to-head, disciplinary, drawing of lots) aren't computable from scores alone; the qualification math is conservative about it, and the bracket uses the resolved teams as ground truth once known.
- **Player & share-card images** are hot-linked from FIFA's CDN; if a URL ever 404s, the dot/preview falls back gracefully.
- **Brand & marks.** The site's own logo is the gold **centre-circle mark** (`assets/mark.svg`) — a pure-geometry pitch centre circle — reused for the favicon, the PWA/home-screen icons (`scripts/make-icons.py`), the social/OG card (`scripts/make-og.py`) and the in-app *About* sheets. The spinning live/goal ball is the public-domain (CC0) `Soccerball.svg`. **No official FIFA emblem, mascot or match-ball imagery is used** — only generic, freely-licensed or original artwork.
- Unofficial fan project; **not affiliated with FIFA**.
